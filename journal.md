3 sensors found on the sphero is the lights, the speed, and the driving stuff.

The main like it the one with all the little dots and can make pictures.

Brain rot just means you start to normally say stuff that is online or funny to you and i personally think its funny but it gets 
tuah point because some people use it on a daily bases and it can be harmfull to peoples intellegence thats why its called brain 
rot because its rotting peoples brains. lore connects to my experience with technology in 2024 because it is often used for 
the meaning of past memories or back stories and i do often see it.
