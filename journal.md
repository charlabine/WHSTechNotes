3 sensors found on the sphero is the lights, the speed, and the driving stuff.
The lights work a lot of different ways theres a front light, a back light, and a main light.
The main like it the one with all the little dots and can make pictures. 
This also helps us know which ball is ours.

and i use my phone to text and communicate.

Software developer:Some main responsibillities for a software developer are debugging and testing and doing the software design.
Some skills you need are python and jave and any language it good for software developing.To be a software developer you
would need 2-6 years of computer science schooling.You could grow as a person as you learn more and more and 
you can be succsessful.This alligns with my goals because it can help you be succseussful and i wanna be that.

Ai can automate repetetive task such as data entry, appointment scheduling,and billing.
its helps people see realisticly how thungs would be if it were to actually happen
it can be harmful because it can make up nad things or fake things that make people belive in 
stuff that isnt real almost like rumors or lies.

i think Computer science is involved with the election because they put in the votes and it keeps rank
of who has more votes and what the people are doing.

Its important to not share your personal stuff because you could have stalkers and people could kidnap you and 
theres also digital footprint so if something happened to you that you want to forget about and you dont want your
college people to see dont share it.I have shared something too personal but i made sure it was deleted and i can know my info
on github is secure because i have my password and i know there are hackers but why would they wanna hack into my git hub.

An event that has been happeing is china has been spying on us because of the tik toks we post give alot of information about us and
i think the computer science community could help with this by simply just making the internet more private and stronger.

Technology has changed the way me make and buy crops because now people order it online and wait for it to come to the house or 
they pay without actual money they pay with cards and they also use technology to keep track of crops to make them more acurate
and healthy and perfect.
# December 2, 2024
I learned that ai is improving as the years go by and its starting to grow unnoticable. This conerns me because sometimes i will
be scrolling on tik tok and it will take me a while to realize the video is ai generated so im concerned for our future being unreal.

Brain rot just means you start to normally say stuff that is online or funny to you and i personally think its funny but it gets 
tuah point because some people use it on a daily bases and it can be harmfull to peoples intellegence thats why its called brain 
rot because its rotting peoples brains. lore connects to my experience with technology in 2024 because it is often used for 
the meaning of past memories or back stories and i do often see it
# December 16, 2024

# January 22, 2025
I think it makes companies worry because if they dont have enough users the company will go down and they will get less money.
I think they could just be more secure and proven that they are maybe make 2 different apps for the seperate countrys.
I would let people see videos that are only in their country and just make two different apps and not allow one another 
to get the other app i can learn security.

They could help or change it by making reactions to errors more effective and just help it in more ways when an error seems to occur maybe put more focus onto it for less risk of peoples literal life.

what i would include for the football coaches is ai to predict what plays there are and whats the best play to make based off of the people that are playing and who is on the team
it would also include search so they could look up senarios for the situation they are in to help the game.

Last week or all last week i learned that even though my soccer team has bad moments in the game, we still get better and were more connected than any other team could be.

A way for people to stay updated on new youth slang is simply just to stay updated or keep up because people come up
 with the most random words or brainrot words out of litteraly the most random stuff.Sometimes the older people evn catch on and use 
 the words on their own. They seem to be "cooler" if they do because its funny to the youth.

For technology i used over spring break i obviously used mobile tech because i use my phone for everything
i used apps mostly to watch tik tok and my shows. I also used it to communitcate with my friends and family.so ya.
# March 24, 2025
I think technology in basketball is pretty cool. I seen there were games during covid where we couldnt see eachother and they would 
have the game playing with the people watching it over the phone or laptop and you could see the faces of the audience watching the 
game.Another thing that basket ball used technology for was when a basketnall player needed a mast but none would help to he had his
face scanned and the mask fit him perfectly to thats pretty cool.

The most stressful part of school lately has been me trying to have the energy to stay up and listen and do my work because im so

finish  and alot appear missing.

Ai is a quick and easy way to get notes and a direct lesson of and on what youre currently learning or studying.
You could look up anything or ask ai anything that you want and it will give you a quick answer. Ai dosent just give you an answer 
though, it gives you steps and what it used to get that answer because thats what ai was used for, not just for people to cheat off 
ai.Theres a difference.
While youre not in school or when youre anywhere working alone you can just ask ai the question and memorize easier than when youre
trying to focus on many things at one while youre in class. So ai does help alot with helping people study quicker and more 
effectively.

I personally think the banning of the cellphones is very considerate and has alot of benefits for helping students focus and 
preventing rude and negative stuff that happens between the students. I think that it would increase the passing level of people and
help people socialize more.
Unfortunately it would leave a lot of people upset and unable to contact people when in need or use their phone and technology for 
things they are doing and need to.
# May 5, 2025
I dont think the 100 men vs a gorilla is irresponsible or anything like that, i think its just a theoretical joke but people really
would like to know who would win.I personally think 100 men would win because even though gorillas are super strong men also arent
that weak and if they all just surround the gorilla taking out all of its defense mechanisms or whatever it is using to fight off
those men it wont be long until they could take the gorilla out like just snap its neck or something.

I think the chromebook challenge is just overall dumb and childish, like people literally do anything but learn at school 
the chromebook challenge is alssuper dangerous and could harm people pretty badly and worse case senario it could burn a whole school
down. The chromebooks also arent even the students to be destroying like that its the schools which they pay for and usually need in 
order to use and provide new upcoming students a chromebook to do their work and use for school. People just shouldnt be doing the
challenge at all and thats that.
