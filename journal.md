3 sensors found on the sphero is the lights, the speed, and the driving stuff.
The lights work a lot of different ways theres a front light, a back light, and a main light.
The main like it the one with all the little dots and can make pictures. 
This also helps us know which ball is ours.

the sphero is different because we didnt have to do to much while coding we just put numbers and stuff but for the python we actually have to code and type words and stuff and were also not working with the balls sphero anymore.
